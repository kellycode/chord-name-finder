# chord-name-finder
This was a project I started in 2018, when my grasp on music theory wasn't as good as it is today.  Back then, I conceptualized everything as chords rather than scales.  Prior to playing a passage in a transcription I was working on, or in traditional sheet music, I would run a measure through this little web page and write the chord notation above the line.  It served as a reminder to my hands of which keys were important.

It has been a great while since I last used it, but I figured it would be nice to make it available for others to use.  It's a simple chord name finder.  Indicate which keys are involved, and it returns the hypothetical names for the chord that those keys would would make.
